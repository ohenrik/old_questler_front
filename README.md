## Consept 
The basic idea of questler is to help people create maintainable and high quality tutorials by borrowing concepts from the StackExchange network. In Questler, a tutorial is divided into small modules consisting of clues and implementation. A clue explains a new concepts. Clues are often complimented by examples of how a concept is used in the context of the current tutorial, these modules are called **Implementations**. Users earn points through up-votes on their tutorials (quests), clues or implementations. They can also contribute to a tutorial by modifying or creating new versions of a tutorial, module or consept.
